# Overview

The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction.

## Key Features of this Python SDK

* Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
* Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts, and tools
* Use standard transports like stdio and SSE
* Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events

## MCP Primitives

The MCP protocol defines three core primitives that servers can implement:

| **Primitive** | **Control** | **Description** | **Example Use** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prompts | User-controlled | Interactive templates invoked by user choice | Slash commands, menu options |
| Resources | Application-controlled | Contextual data managed by the client application | File contents, API responses |
| Tools | Model-controlled | Functions exposed to the LLM to take actions | API calls, data updates |
