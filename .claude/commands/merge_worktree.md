Your task is to merge changes from the .trees/$ARGUMENTS worktree into main.

Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you're on the main branch
2. Merge the worktree branch: `git merge .trees/$ARGUMENTS`
3. If there are merge conflicts, use "git status",
   "git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U", or
   "git ls-files -u" to list files that have merge conflicts
4. Manually resolve conflicts based upon your knowledge of the changes
5. Complete the merge with `git commit` if needed
